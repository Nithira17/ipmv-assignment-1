This project contains solutions and code for the Image Processing and Machine Vision (IPMV) Assignment 1.

## Project Structure

- `assignment.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook with all assignment solutions and code.
- `requirements.txt` — List of Python dependencies required to run the notebook.
- `a1images/` — Folder containing all images used in the assignment.
    - `a1q5images/` — Subfolder with additional images for question 5.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Recommended: Use a virtual environment (e.g., conda or venv)

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or, if using conda:
   ```
   conda activate <your_env>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open `assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

### Usage
- Run the cells in `assignment.ipynb` to execute the solutions and view results.
- All required images are in the `a1images/` folder and subfolders.

## Folder Details
- `a1images/` contains images such as:
    - `brain_proton_density_slice.png`
    - `daisy.jpg`
    - `einstein.png`
    - `emma.jpg`
    - `highlights_and_shadows.jpg`
    - `jeniffer.jpg`
